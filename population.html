        China is the most populous nation in the world. In 1982, China’s Population reached the billion mark.<br>
        But according to this graph, you will realize that population decreased in 1959, 1960, and 1961. What happened? 
        </p>
        <div id = 'first-chart'></div>
        
        <p class = 'intro'>
        Let take a look at the Birth Rate and Death Rate over the year. <br>
        The Death Rate was higher than the Birth Rate in 1960 and 1961.

        <div id = 'second-chart'></div>
        
        <p class = 'intro'>
        So the natural growth rate was negative in 1960 and 1961. 
        </p>
        <p class='show'>This was affected by the Great China Famine. According to historian research, approximatelly 22～30 million people died. Based on History of Chinese Communist website, Chinese population decreased approximately 10 million in 1960.</p>

        <p class = "intro">What lead to the Great China Famine?</p>
        <p id = 'text-box'>
            The first reason stated by Chinese official is different types of natural diseasters including flood and drought from 1958 to 1961. What did weather data show at that time?
        </p>
        <p id = 'text-box' class = 'show2'>
            The data addressed that threre were definitely severe natural diseasters from 1959 to 1961. But at the year of 1972, a similar level of natural diseaster, especially on drought, didn't cause the significant drop in food production. So there were other factors caused the famine.
